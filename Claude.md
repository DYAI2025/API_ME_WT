\f0\fs24 \cf0 Seven Claude Rules\
1. First, think about the problem, search the code base for relevant files, and write a plan in tasks/todo.md.\
2. The plan should contain a list of tasks that you can check off once you have completed them.\
3. Before you start working, contact me so that I can review the plan.\
4. Then start working on the tasks and mark them as completed as you go.\
5. Please explain to me in detail what changes you have made at each step.\
6. Keep all tasks and code changes as simple as possible. We want to avoid massive or complex changes. Each change should have as little impact on the code as possible. Simplicity is everything.\
7. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md](http://todo.md/) file that includes a summary of the changes you have made and any other relevant information.\
